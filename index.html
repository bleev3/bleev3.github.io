                                    I was using to generate the C note, the frequency for the C note was registering between 1310 
                                    and 1320.</p>

                                <p>I needed to set up a virtual environment in Python.</p>

                                <p> I also installed the ArduinoBLE library in the Arduino IDE. Then, I got the MAC address
                                     of the Artemis board by running the ble_arduino code.</p>
                                <!-- MAC Address -->

                                <p>Then, the MAC address and UUID was changed in the connections.yaml file 
                                    so that I could connect the Artemis to my computer.</p>

                                <p>On the Arduino side, the ble_arduino.ino file provides the MAC address for the Artemis board and 
                                    advertises that this device is available to be connected. We then generate a specific uuid on the 
                                    python side in order to create a unique identifier for our specific Artemis board. 
                                    Using python, the computer will scan for available devices and search for my Artemis board that has a 
                                    unqiue MAC address and UUID pair. Once connected, the Artemis and computer can exchange messages back 
                                    and forth using Bluetooth. 
                                    </p>

                                <p>(1) I edited the ECHO command on the Arduino side so when it receives a string from the computer, 
                                    it can send back “Robot says ->” along with the original string. </p>

                                <p>(2) I created a new command called SEND_THREE_FLOATS on the Arduino side which parses the three 
                                    floats sent by the computer. Then, it prints out the three floats in the serial monitor.  </p>

                                <p>(3) On the Arduino side, for GET_TIME_MILLIS, I used the currentMillis variable to get 
                                    the current time in milliseconds by calling the millis() function. Then on the python side, 
                                    the current time was sent back to the computer. </p>
                                <!-- Get Time Millis: Add photo for arduino code and python -->

                                <p>(4) I created a notification handler that takes the response string from the 
                                    Artemis and parses the message, so it retrieves just the time. </p>
                                <!-- Notification Handler: Add photo for arduino code and python -->
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/fullsize/notif_handler.jpg" alt="Python Notification Handler" />
                                 <p>(5) I created a command called GET_DATA which collects and sends data for 10 seconds. 
                                    The notification handler is used to extract the time from the message. 
                                    The effective data transfer rate is 242 messages/10 secs = 24.2 messages/sec.
                                </p>
                                <!-- Get Data code: Arduino and Python -->

                                 <p>(6) For SEND_TIME_DATA, I first collected the data for 10 seconds into an array of length 700.
                                     Once either the time reached 10 seconds or the array was filled, then we would send each data 
                                     in the array to the computer. </p>
                                <!-- SEND_TIME_DATA code: Arduino and Python -->
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/fullsize/senddata_arduino.jpg" alt="Arduino Send Data" /> 
                                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/portfolio/fullsize/senddata_python.jpg" alt="Python Send Data" />
                                <p>(7) For GET_TEMP_READINGS, I used the same structure of collecting the time and temperature for 10 seconds
                                     into arrays of length 700. Then, I would send out the data once the arrays had been filled or we reached 10 seconds.
                                    I also created a notification handler on the python side which would separate the time and temperature 
                                    and put it into time and temp arrays respectively.

                                 <p>(8) The first method where you send live data allows you to get the data almost instantaneously since you 
                                    send the data right after you have received the measurement.  This method can be useful when you want to make 
                                    quick decisions based on real time data. 
                                    The second method where you send data after it has been collected in an array allows you to record the data at 
                                    a much faster rate since there are no interrupts from the computer or the BLE service. The second method is useful 
                                    when you want to send data after you have completed a trial or a test. 
                                    I am sending floats to represent the time and the temperature. Each float is 4 bytes. In turn, if we have 
                                    384kB of RAM, we can store 384kB/8 bytes which is 48,000 data points.

                                <p>I tested the data rate by first sending a string called “Hello”. 
                                    Then, I created a function similar to ECHO called ECHO_BYTES_BACK. Then I created a loop that increments the 
                                    message being sent by 5 bytes each time. 
                                    I would calculate the difference between when the message was sent and when the response message was received. 
                                    In a separate loop, I calculated the byte length and data rate and then generated a graph shown below.
                                </p>

                                    The data rate for 5-byte replies is around 20 bytes/second while 120-byte replies is about 500 bytes/second. 
                                    Short replies introduce a lot of overhead because you need to send multiple packets 
                                    to transmit a large amount of data. Each message contains a certain amount of overhead. As a result, since you 
                                    need to send more packets, there will be a greater total amount of overhead as compared to larger packets.
                                    Larger replies help to reduce overhead because you can use fewer packets to send over a large amount of data. 
                                    Because each message contains a large amount of data, the overhead is small as compared to the size of the actual 
                                    data you want to send. </p>
                                <h11 class="mt-4"><u>Reliability</u></h11>
                                <p>When you send data at a higher rate from the robot to the computer, the computer is 
                                    able to read all of the data published. I tested this by sending over an array that 
                                    had 1000 entries containing the time in milliseconds from the Artemis to the computer 
                                    and the computer was able to receive all 1000 entries. The caveat is that since the 
                                    data points were floats, there may have been a smaller overhead resulting in less data 
                                    being transmitted overall.</p>
                                <h12 class="mt-4"><u>Discussion</u></h12>
                                <p>I learned about the onboard Artemis board sensors and how Bluetooth can be used to transmit 
                                    data between Artemis and the computer. It was also interesting to see how the data rate could 
                                    increase or decrease depending on whether there were print statements in both the Arduino and Python code.</p>

                                <p>As I flip the board, the z value on the acceleration and gyroscope data become negative. As I rotate the board (ie on the y axis), 
                                    then the x and y values change to be either positive or negative. When I accelerate the board, the x, y, and z values increase.

                                    Since the sampling rate was 398.72 for pitch, the alpha value was determined to be 0.0451
                                    For the roll, the sampling rate was 362.58. Therefore, the alpha value was 0.0797.
                                    As can be seen from the graphs shown below, the low pass filter eliminates most of the noise (even during vibrations) in the

                                <p>Compared to the accelerometer, the gyroscope is more susceptiple to noise and small vibrations. It is due
                                    to the gyroscope taking the result of the previous measurements and adding it to the current measurement
                                    in order to get the estimated angle for pitch, roll, and yaw.
                                    Therefore, small errors in the predicted angle can accumulate.

                                <p>I used an alpha value of 0.85 for the complementary filter meaning that most of the 
                                    weight used to calculate the angle for pitch/roll is on the accelerometer data. I chose 
                                    to use the accelerometer data more because it does not flucuate as much with noise.
                                    The complementary filter works best between the -90 and 90 degree range.
